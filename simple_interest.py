#In this exercise you will create a function that will show the user the total call of a simple interest loan. 
#The formula for simple interest is Interest = principal x rate x time
p = principal
t = time
r = rate

print("Enter the principal in dollars:")
principal = input(p)
print("Your principal is"+ principal)

print("Enter the principal in dollars:")
time = input(t)
print("Your time is"+ time)

print("Enter the principal in dollars:")
rate = input(r)
print("Your rate is"+ rate)

p= input('enter value for p')
t= input('enter value for t')
r= input('enter value for r')

print(int(p)*int(r)*int(t))




#def simple_interest(p,t,r): 
 #   print('The principal is', p) 
  #  print('The time period is', t) 
  #  print('The rate of interest is',r) 
      
    #si = (p * t * r)/100
      
    #print('The Simple Interest is', si) 
    #return si 
      
# Driver code 
#simple_interest(8, 6, 8) 

#Prompt the user to enter their principal



#Prompt the user to enter their interest rate


#Prompt the user to enter the time of their loan in years


#calculate the to total interest


#Calculate the total amount the user would pay
